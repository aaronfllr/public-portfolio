+++<u>+++*CURRENT PROJECTS*+++</u>+++ +
*GO MTB open* +

This is a project that was founded by me and two Developer friends to fill a need in the local mountain bike community. The tech stack currently being used is Next.js and Springboot. We are utilizing an Adaptive Design system and I have built a prototype for the CI/CD pipeline between the UI and the Figma designs utilizing Next.js, Figma, Storybook, and Chromatic where our eventual component tests will live. + 
 +

*The Artisan Pantry* +

This is a paid project where I am working with another developer to create a web presence for an up and coming Bakery before they launch. The tech stack is Next.js, Supabase (Open Source Firebase alternative), Postgres, and MUI's UI Library. +
 +

+++<u>+++*PERSONAL PROJECTS*+++</u>+++ +
*Fitness Tracker* +
This is a passion project stemming from the lack of open APIs in the trackers that I have come across. The Architecture is React Native and Postgres developed in a NixOS environment. The end goal is to share workouts with friends and trainers. A much needed feature in the Group Fitness Instructor environment. +
